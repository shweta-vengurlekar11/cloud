# **CLOUD COMPUTING**

## What is cloud computng?
Cloud is the customized and on-demand delivery of resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.as per the resouces used you pay cost which is called as rent.

Cloud mainly have 3 types:

1. *public cloud*: resources provided to use by anyone.via internet.eg.amazon provides aws,microsoft provides azure.
2. *private cloud*: resources provided to the authorized people which are part of organization.
3. *hybrid cloud*: it is the combination of private and public cloud.lets say 1 organization has their own employee using private cloud and has customers that are using public cloud.

## Advantages of cloud:
1. cost effective:you need not to pay huge amount for the resources at one time.on cloud we need to pay only for the resources which we are using. Eg.we created a laptop which has some resouces . so for period of time we are using laptop we have to pay some rent for that resources.
2. portable: we can change anytime the resources we are using so that we need not pay for those resources which we are not going to use for so long. Eg.a laptop resources can be changed according to our need.and pay the rent for that much of period and again we can change the resources after using.
3. we can stop using resources whenever we want either by stop using it or terminate it.so that for the time we are not using resources we don't need to pay rent for them.
